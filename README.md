Data Browser Student Project
  * Database displayed on a webpage for the user to scroll through data.
  * Allows the user to manage data stored in server side and have it displayed on the client side.

How to use:
  * Download zip
  * Place in the htcdocs folder within the xampp directory
  * Run the "create_db.php" file (this will take the initial data from "opdata.json" and create a mysql database).
  * Open the databrowser.html file, change the path in the url section to "localhost/...../databrowser.html"
  * Click "load data" button to load data from the server database.
  * Now you're free to use the rest of the buttons to edit, add, sort, and view the data!
  * Note that when you want to upload an image, you must include the file path from the images folder to that image (images/image.jpg).
